## Problem Statement
Personal finance tools are very segmented and can be difficult to navigate. We want to create an easy-to-use tool which allows the user to track various aspects of personal finance. This will be different from existing or similar services due to its navigable UI as well as its combination of existing services into one application. It will also attempt to further the publicâ€™s financial literacy through the use of pictorial representations and other devices to help those who may not understand financial terms used in other, similar products.

## Project Objectives
- Build a website which will be able to provide a dashboard to manage personal finances and view stock portfolio
- Create user profiles for storing personal information and data on personal finances
- Maintain a backend service to facilitate communication from the application and database
- Develop a system to manage finances such as budgeting and expense report
- Develop a system to view stock information and alert users of changes
